Create the Menu class.

Create an intro, and allow the player to set rules in an options menu.

Create the AI.


add a multiplayer mode, or play against AI
(A* pathfinding will be necessary for AI)

Difficulty settings:
    add a hard mode where the snake gets faster with each growth
    add a setting to change the speed at which food appears
    add a setting to change the size of the playfield
    add a setting to decide whether borders are walls or not.


An example of some planning I did once. Do this more often:

#How can I get the locations from the wall PFO's and put them into "changedNodes" from the PlayField instance?
        #   add wall locations as Wall instance variables?
        #       would add unnecessary bloat
        #       could work, could grab wall locations from snake body
        #       copying wall locations into a list would take time
        #   
        #   use dict keys returned from Draw method?
        #       Would have to use Snake.Move() return value, which includes the head
        #       Head movement not clearly defined, would need a method to remove it
        #       Giving the dictionary ordered keys would be very costly.
        #
        #


The menu class:

    must have at least one element.

    Can have any number of elements

    Elements are displayed in a drop-down menu

    If elements are selected, they run custom methods

    If elements aren't selectable, they get skipped over
